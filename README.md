The double-edged sword of revealing mental health issues at work
#A man suspected of killing 18 people in a shooting in Maine has been found dead after a three-day manhunt, police say.

"The suspect in Wednesday night's shootings has been located and is deceased," the Androscoggin County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook.

The news comes hours after police lifted a shelter in place order for the normally quiet community.

Among the dead are a grandfather, a talented young bowler, and four deaf locals, ranging in age from 14 to 76.

It is unclear where the body of Robert Card, 40, was found or how he died.

At a news conference at Lewiston City Hall, Maine Governor Janet Mills said the body was found in Lisbon, nearby where the shooting occurred.

"I'm breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card will not be a threat to anyone," she said.

Lewiston Police Chief David St Pierre added that he was "elated" by the news, but "our work is not done here".
