Sri Lanka have been suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) because of government interference.

Sri Lanka's ministry of sport sacked the national board (SLC) amid the team's poor World Cup, although the decision was reversed by a court.

The ICC board determined "Sri Lanka is in serious breach of its obligations as a member".

The terms of the suspension, including any potential ramifications, will be decided at the next ICC board meeting.

The ICC said Sri Lanka had broken "the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there is no government interference in the governance, regulation and/or administration".

Sri Lanka have won just two of their nine games at the World Cup so far, leaving them ninth in the table.

They are coached by former England coach Chris Silverwood.

Last week sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe described the SLC as "traitorous and corrupt" in a statement to parliament and called for board members to resign.

Secretary Mohan de Silva quit and the board was sacked.

Ranasinghe replaced them with an interim committee chaired by World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, although a petition against the dismissal was granted a two-week stay order by a court this week.

SLC also issued a statement on allegations made by Ranasinghe about supposed financial irregularities.
